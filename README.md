# print_reverse
Prints the string that you are given in reverse order

There are two different approach:
- Iterating
- Recursive

First approach will represent iterative approach that is we are familiar with most of the time.
Second approach will represent recursive approach with pointers , I hope it will help you to understand recursivity and pointers.
